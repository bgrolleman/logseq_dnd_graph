## LogSeq DND Template

This is a graph that can be used as a base for DND campaign tracking, all
special pages are in the DND/ space. If you want to customize either send me a
pull request or move from DND/ to Custom/ space, that way you can easily get the
latest version and just overwrite all DND\_\_\_\* files.

Hope you enjoy and feel free to help improve
